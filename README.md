# Abou me

### A few things about me and who i am.

My name is Robert Dacina But, I am originally from Romania, but currently I live in Norway.

I love traveling, a quiet and relaxing evening, good food , the company of great friends and ofcourse  as you can see in my GitHub account, i also love designing and developing things. 
I started my design journey in 2018 and i because i wanted to learn more about how things work not just how they supposed to look, so in the autumn of 2021 i started my development journey at Noroff.

Fell free to have a look at my recent projects.

# My work

Because I only started my development career in 2021, I can say that as a fresh developer, I'm eager to learn and understand more about programming and how things work online.

Below I listed some projects that got me started on this fantastic journey, feel free to take a look, and if you find something you like or spark your interest, I would be pleased to know about it.
