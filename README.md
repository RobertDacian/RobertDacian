### A few things about me and who i am.

My name is Robert Dacina But, I am originally from Romania, but currently I live in Norway.

I love traveling, a quiet and relaxing evening, good food , the company of great friends and ofcourse  as you can see in my GitHub account, i also love designing and developing things. 
I started my design journey in 2018 and i because i wanted to learn more about how things work not just how they supposed to look, in the autumn of 2021 i started my development journey at Noroff.

Fell free to have a look at my recent projects.
